        <p><h1>Fundamentals of HTML</h1></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><h2>Text Formatting</h2></p>
        <p>A paragraph with <i>some words that are emphasized</i> and <b>some important words.</b> Followed by some <mark>highlighted words.</mark> Feel free to add any other text formatting that appeals to you. </p>
        <pre>
    This is some text
    that is laid out exactly
    Laid out at code level without any additional
    markup
        </pre>

        <p><h2>Special Characters</h2></p>
        <pre>
The browser thinks &lt; is a programming character. Also &gt;. The browser also ignores any line breaks
in your code andy any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;white space. To include these you need to use special characters aka html entities. There are other entities available such as &#8356; and &</is>    
        </pre>
        <p><h2>Links</h2></p>
        <p>A web page without any links is a unique and peculiar find. You can have links to separate sites such as <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/">Leeds Beckett</a>. Links to other pages of the<a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/distance-learning/"> same site.</a>
Links to another point in the<a href ="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/distance-learning/what-is-distance-learning/"> same page</a> </p>

        <p><h2>Images</h2></p>
        <p>This image is stored on this server in an image sub-folder <img src="WAT1.jpeg" alt="WAT1" style="width:75px;height:75px;"></p>
<pre>

I hope you added an alt attribute to support screen readers

Why not check to see what happens if you try to validate your code using the W3C Markup Validation Service without the alt attribute included. If you right click on the page and chose inspect or 
view source you can check your code and see the HTML comment you have added just inside the body tag
